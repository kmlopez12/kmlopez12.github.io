## Reflection

### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?
-I still being a data scientist is about knowing computer science and larger data sets in order to manipulate and analyze the data. While I still also believe these skills can tranfers to a variety of fields (biology, sports, etc.), I also think it's better that the data scientist have some detailed knowledge about the data topic in order to conduct meaningful analyses. While this person can work closely with experts on the field, it's ultimately the data scientist who will perform the analyses and modeling, so learning about the field they're in can be just as important as knowing computer science.

### What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
