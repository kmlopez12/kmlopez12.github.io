### Github Pages Repo Link  
My project 2 Github pages repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/kmlopez12/ST558-Project2).

### What would you do differently?  
Given more time, I would like to find a way to incorporate parallel programming to create the reports simultaneously and faster. Then it may be nice to delve into the hours dataset to find any trends of usage during different times of the days.

### What was the most difficult part for you?  
I believe I had the most trouble with automating the rending of the document to create a report for each day of the week. I was able to follow the video and lecture on this topic but didn't see it done until this project. Once I figured out how to properly compose the Rscript and run it, it was relieveing to watch the reports populate.

### What are your big take-aways from this project?  
My big takeaways are that redundancy is greatly reducde with automation of R markdown documents. It was nice to leave the machine running and not have to manually create a file for each weekday. I can imagine this being scaled up to daily reports, if desired by a supervisor, so automation would make these types of task easier. I also could see how parallel programming could fit into these types of tasks as well. The reports are independent of each other and would generate even faster if done simultaneuously on different nodes.
