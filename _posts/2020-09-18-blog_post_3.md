title: Project 1 Blog Post
---

### Once you’ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog post:  
• explaining what you did in the project and any findings you made  
• You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:  
  – what would you do differently in approaching the project?  
  – what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?  
  – what are your big take-aways for future projects?  
• In your blog post, provide a link to your github pages repo: https://github.com/kmlopez12/ST558-Project1
